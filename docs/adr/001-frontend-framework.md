# ADR-001: Choice of Next.js 14 for Frontend Framework

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-01-01

## Context
We need to select a frontend framework for the Cursor Rules Hub application that can handle:
- Static site generation for performance
- Server-side rendering for SEO
- Dynamic client-side functionality for search
- Modern developer experience
- Large-scale rule database presentation

## Decision
We will use Next.js 14 with the App Router as our frontend framework.

## Rationale

### Advantages of Next.js 14
1. **Hybrid Rendering**: Supports SSG, SSR, and CSR in a single application
2. **App Router**: Modern file-based routing with layouts and nested routes
3. **Performance**: Built-in optimizations (image optimization, code splitting, etc.)
4. **SEO-Friendly**: Excellent meta tag and structured data support
5. **TypeScript Integration**: First-class TypeScript support
6. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, error overlay, and debugging tools
7. **Ecosystem**: Large community and extensive plugin ecosystem

### Alternatives Considered

#### React SPA with Vite
- **Pros**: Fast development, simple deployment
- **Cons**: Poor SEO, no SSR, limited meta tag control
- **Verdict**: Insufficient for our SEO requirements

#### Gatsby
- **Pros**: Great for static sites, GraphQL integration
- **Cons**: Complex build process, overkill for our use case
- **Verdict**: Too complex for our relatively simple data structure

#### Nuxt.js (Vue)
- **Pros**: Similar features to Next.js, Vue ecosystem
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, team unfamiliar with Vue
- **Verdict**: Next.js has better React ecosystem support

#### SvelteKit
- **Pros**: Small bundle size, good performance
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less mature
- **Verdict**: Too new, smaller community

## Implementation Details

### App Router Structure
```
src/app/
├── layout.tsx          # Root layout
├── page.tsx           # Home page
├── categories/        # Category pages
├── rules/            # Rule detail pages
├── search/           # Search functionality
└── api/              # API routes
```

### Rendering Strategy
- **Static Generation**: Category pages, rule detail pages
- **Client-Side Rendering**: Search results, interactive components
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: For future dynamic content

### Performance Optimizations
- Image optimization with next/image
- Code splitting by route
- Lazy loading of non-critical components
- Font optimization with next/font

## Consequences

### Positive
- Excellent SEO performance for rule discovery
- Fast initial page loads with SSG
- Good developer experience
- Future-proof with modern React patterns
- Easy deployment to Vercel

### Negative
- Learning curve for App Router (new paradigm)
- Some complexity in hybrid rendering setup
- Potential build time increases with large datasets

### Neutral
- Vendor lock-in to React ecosystem (acceptable given team expertise)
- Framework opinions on project structure (beneficial for consistency)

## Follow-up Actions
1. Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript
2. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
3. Set up Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Implement basic routing structure
5. Configure deployment pipeline for Vercel
